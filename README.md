# Raymonds-Tree-based-distributed-mutual-exclusion-algorithm
Implemented a mutual exclusion service using Raymonds tree-based distributed mutual exclusion algorithm.Each process or node consists of two separate modulesâ€“one module that implements the application (requests and executes critical sections) and one module that implements the mutual exclusion algorithm (coordinates critical section executions of all processes so that they do not overlap). Intuitively, the two modules interact using cs-enter and cs-leave function calls. Each module in turn may be implemented using one or more threads.
